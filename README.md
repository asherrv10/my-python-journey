py_journey

This repository contains solutions to basic and intermediate Python problems and exercises implemented in Jupyter Notebook format. The focus is on core Python programming, such as dictionaries, functions, list operations, user input, and printing patterns.
📁 Contents

py_journey.ipynb
A Jupyter Notebook with Python code blocks covering:

    Dictionary manipulations and comprehensions

    Counting frequencies of list elements

    Working with copy() and dictionary references

    Defining and calling functions (including *args and lambdas)

    Using filter with custom predicates

    Printing various patterns (squares, rectangles, triangles)

    Simple mathematical functions (area, distance calculation)

    Attempted list rotation (untested/incomplete)

Sample topics and outputs are included in code cell outputs.
